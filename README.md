DSC 590 - COVID-19 recession independent study, part 1

This is a project I completed as part of a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and TransUnion to analyze 
the effects of the covid recession on different socioeconomic groups in the state of New York at the zip code level. 
It is Google Colab file, written in Python, that consists of exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, identifying 
two dependent variables, linear modeling, and stepwise selection.
